            <h2>More Fun Facts About Cats</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Whisker Wonders</h3>
                <p>Did you know that a cat's whiskers are roughly as wide as its body? This helps them navigate through tight spaces.</p>
                <h3>Communication</h3>
                <p>Cats use a variety of vocalizations to communicate with their humans. From purrs to meows to chirps, each sound conveys a different message.</p>
                <h3>Toe Beans</h3>
                <p>The soft pads on a cat's paws are often referred to as "toe beans" due to their bean-like appearance. These pads help cats walk quietly and provide cushioning.</p>
                <h3>Ancient Pets</h3>
                <p>Cats were domesticated around 9,000 years ago in the Near East. They were worshipped in ancient Egypt and often depicted in artwork and statues.</p>
                <h3>Purring Power</h3>
                <p>Cats purr not only when they're content but also to self-soothe. Purring can have a calming effect on cats and helps in their healing process.</p>
                <h3>Unique Noseprints</h3>
                <p>Just like human fingerprints, each cat's noseprint is unique and can be used to identify them.</p>

                <h3>Feline Flexibility</h3>
                <p>Cats are incredibly flexible due to their unique skeletal structure. They have 230 to 250 bones in their bodies, while humans have 206. This allows them to twist and bend their bodies in ways that seem almost impossible.</p>
